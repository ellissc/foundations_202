Analysis of Diachronic Language Change
	There are two accounts of how meaning representations are formed. According to one account, the structure of semantic knowledge results from direct perceptual experience and abstract reasoning about unseen properties of the world (Kim et al., 2019). Therefore, changes in the statistical patterns of the language should have little effect on how an individual’s semantic representations evolve as they age. In another account, meaning representations are shaped by language experience: listeners learn word meanings in part by tracking their patterns of co-occurrence with other words (Landau et al., 1985; Lewis, 2019). Since the statistical patterns of words can change across decades (Hamilton et al., 2016; Michel et al., 2011), the experience-based account would suggest that older adults, who aggregate language exposure over many decades, will arrive at different semantic representations relative to their younger counterparts, for words whose co-occurrence patterns have changed over their lifetime. Indeed, previous work indicates that lexical association networks become sparser as individuals age (Dubossarsky et al., 2017) and that event-related potential effects of semantic relatedness are reduced in older adults (Federmeier et al., 2010), indicating that some aspects of lexico-semantic processing change with age. 
	Beginning with how meaning changes over time, I will use the free-association data from the Small World of Words (SWOW; De Deyne et al., 2019) and the HistWords toolkit (Hamilton et al., 2016), a set of word meaning vectors pre-trained on data from specific time periods. First, co-occurrence matrices for several age groups will be generated from SWOW cues and responses, which will be used to generate vector representations for each word. Then, cosine distance between each word pair will be computed to generate representational dissimilarity matrices (RDM; Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) for each age group. Next, the HistWords word vectors will be used to generate per-decade RDMs using the same calculation over the same set of words. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) will be used to compare the individual or combinations of HistWords matrices to the SWOW matrices, with the final goal of finding the combination of HistWords matrices which best fit to the human data. This could be averaging the decade representations evenly over an individual’s lifespan (e.g., average meaning from 50s onward for a 70 y.o. individual) or weighting the earlier decades more heavily to reflect the primacy of early language learning (e.g., assigning a higher weight to 60s and 70s meaning for a 70 y.o. individual). In addition, these will be used to identify words whose meanings have changed over the last 60 years (e.g., “Script” as in “Letter” vs “Computer program”), as well as words whose meanings appear to have remained stable.
	Next, electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to observe and compare the semantic representations of individuals with different linguistic experience (i.e., from different age groups), since studies have shown that the N400 reflects semantic processing (Federmeier et al., 2010; Kutas et al., 2000), I will collect EEG data from young (20-25 y.o.) and older (70-75 y.o.) adults as they are processing words selected from the first part (half words that changed in meaning and half those that were stable). On each trial, participants will hear a word and then, after a brief delay, answer a Yes/No question about that word. After the EEG data are preprocessed and time- locked to the critical word, average voltage over a typical auditory N400 time window will be extracted for each channel and averaged across 10 repetitions, creating a vector of length 64 for each word. EEG-based RDM will be created for each participant using pairwise cosine distance of EEG-based word vectors. 
	From these analyses, RDMs will be generated to capture semantic representations from the three sources; behavioral (SWOW free-association), corpora (HistWords), and neural (EEG). RSA will be used to see if diachronic change in lexico-semantic representations is reflected in the neural representational spaces of individuals receiving language input over their lifetime spanning different time periods. 
	In conclusion, this research will expand on the relationship between semantic processing and linguistic experience by connecting EEG-based measures of semantic representation to those derived from large language datasets (corpora, free-association norms), in addition to focusing on diachronic differences. The results will also contribute to the debate about the importance of linguistic structure and experience in forming semantic representations, through explicit testing and manipulation of the co-occurrence statistics.
